PDP Image Manipulator

Overview
The PDP Image Manipulator is a graphical user interface (GUI) application designed for easy and
intuitive image processing. It allows users to perform various transformations on images and
visualizes pixel frequencies across the RGB color channels.

Features

Image Loading
- Load Button: Users can load images into the application for editing by clicking the 'Load' button. The path of the loaded image is displayed next to the button.

Image Saving
- Save Button: Processed images can be saved back to the system. Upon saving, the file path of the saved image will be displayed for user reference.

Preview Mode
- Split View Slider: This feature provides a split-view slider that allows users to preview image transformations in real-time, comparing the original and edited images side by side.

Color Channel Visualization
- RGB Checkbox: Users can visualize the frequency of pixels for Red, Green, and Blue channels separately. This helps in analyzing the color composition of the image.

Transformation Buttons
The application offers a range of image transformations which include:
- Horizontal Flip: Flips the image horizontally.
- Vertical Flip: Flips the image vertically.
- Blur: Applies a blur effect to the image.
- Sharpen: Sharpens the image details.
- Greyscale: Converts the image to luma component.
- Sepia: Applies a sepia tone for a vintage look.
- Color Correct: Allows for color correction adjustments.
- Compress: Reduces the image file size.
- Level Adjust: Adjusts the levels of shadows, midtones, and highlights.

Pixel Frequencies
- Histogram: The application generates a histogram that displays the distribution of pixel intensities across the RGB channels. This is useful for understanding the image's exposure and color balance.

Undo Functionality
- Undo: Users can revert to the previous state of the image before the last transformation was applied.

USAGE
To use the PDP Image Manipulator GUI, follow these steps:
1. Click 'Load' to open an image.
2. Select the desired image transformations.
3. Use the Preview Mode slider to view changes in real-time.
4. Check or uncheck the RGB channels to visualize pixel frequencies.
5. Click 'Save' to download the edited image.
